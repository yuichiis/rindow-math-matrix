Rindow Math Matrix is the fundamental package for scientific matrix operation

- A powerful N-dimensional array object
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ through the "rindow_openblas" extension
- Useful linear algebra and random number capabilities



Please see the documents on [Rindow projects](https://rindow.github.io/) web pages.




### Download the rindow_openblas extension

You can perform very fast N-dimensional array operations in conjunction

- [Pre-build binaries](https://github.com/rindow/rindow-openblas/releases)
- [Build from source](https://github.com/rindow/rindow-openblas)

### Acceleration with GPU

You can use GPU acceleration on OpenCL.

- [Pre-build binaries](https://github.com/rindow/rindow-clblast/releases)
- [Build from source](https://github.com/rindow/rindow-clblast)
